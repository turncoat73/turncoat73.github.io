<p>My formal education, albeit quite a while ago now, was in biochemistry and microbiology (more specifically, wine microbiology).  I don't have any real formal education in computer science besides a Udacity certification, which turned out to be challenging and rigorous.</p>

<p>As I finished up this Udacity certification around a year ago I wanted to keep using what I learned so I didn't lose what I learned.  But, it really did beg the question - what kind of website to create?  I could blog about my daily life, which really isn't all that unique.  A self-righteous, holier-than-thou blog about how my political views could have been a way to go, but nah.  There's enough of that.</p>

<p>Looking back on life, career, and education, I do remember a time when I was getting deep into biochemistry.  I really would lose all track of time learning the endless aspects of all the different pathways.  The intricacies of the chemical structures were cool and fun to draw (which I had to do thousands upon thousands of times).  Learning how all the different pathways interconnected with each other was exciting.  As I learned all of this over the course of my undergrad degree, I'll even admit to being kind of a show-off (I think this is called "nerd bragging" these days).</p>

<p>But, life happens.  It's amazing that, when life happens, if gained knowledge isn't used, it fades.  I started asking myself though - why not revisit these fundamentals that were so exciting to learn back in the day?  How do I take my recently gained (and largely self-taught) knowledge and combine it with my formal (albeit older) formal education?</p>

<p>I started using the Python module Tkinter to draw some of these structures (or more accurately two-dimensional representations of chemical structures).  I'm getting into this.  Going through the process of combining old education with newly acquired knowledge has been an interesting little venture so far.</p>

<p>Is what I'm doing here of any potential value to others?  Hard to say.  It's not hard to do simple web searches and come up with representations of molecules and pathways that are far more elaborate than anything I've done so far.  But, I think there is some potential value in this project, so I'm going to continue for the time being.</p>

<p>The functions I've built so far may have a few too many lines of code, but they are much smaller in size than any file where a drawing program was used to draw chemical structures.</p>

<p>Here's a few examples.</p>

<p>Glucose:</p>

<p>Fructose:</p>

<p>Is what I'm doing here of any potential value to others?  Hard to say.  It's not hard to do simple web searches and come up with representations of molecules and pathways that are far more elaborate than anything I've done so far.  But, I think there is some potential value in this project, so I'm going to continue for the time being.</p>

<p>Using code to draw the structures allows for a lot more flexibility.  There is a lot more potential to introduce animation, which would really help with understanding.  Users would have to either know a little Python or get help from someone who is familiar with both coding and biochemistry.</p>

<p>Creating this for educational purposes is an obvious justification.  Taking this a little further - the disdain for science in contemporary society is alarming.  I'm constantly asking myself how all of society can be influenced to hunger for scientific knowledge can be accomplished.  Putting a coding spin on biochemistry is worth a try.  If someone takes what I've started and makes it better, then my effort was worth it.</p>

<p>Acquiring funding for scientific research is getting more and more difficult.  It shouldn't be this way, but it is what it is.  Tools to facilitate visual representation of fundamental knowledge, recent findings, and project potential are key to enabling sound decision making.</p>
