	<p>Well, I always thought I was a decent writer, given that I've had to do a lot of it throughout school and career.</p>

	<p>But now, I'm staring at a fairly blank HTML page wondering what to say.</p>	
	
	<p>For now, I'll just try and anticipate a few questions and answer them I guess.</p>
	
	<p><b><em>Why am I doing this?</em></b>  Why not?  I spent a bunch of time (and money) last year learning HTML, CSS, Python, and a little Javascript.  I wanted to try and use it before I forget it.  Crazy how much I've forgotten already  Looking at the current layout of this site, one could be easily forgiven for thinking "helloooo 1995".  Fair enough.  I get it.  It will be improved as I go along.</p>
		
	<p><b><em>Why spend time learning these programming languages?</em></b>  I've got a decent grasp on Python already.  I wanted to get some sort of formal certification, so I did Udacity's Introduction to Programming class.  It was no joke.  It got a little frustrating at times.  When it got frustrating my tendency was to keep grinding.  Big mistake.  It's important to walk away, take a break, come back to it.  I should have engaged people on the forums a whole lot more.</p>
	
	<p><b><em>What will this site be about?</em></b>  I do a lot of quasi-techie projects on my time and my dime.  If I think something's worthwhile, I'll post it. Given that I'm using GitHub to host this site, it should be used for this purpose.  If there's code involved, I'll share the code.  I will avoid writing narcicisstic tomes imposing my views of how the world oughtta be.  If readers want that, then social media is what you're looking for.  However, I am somewhat philanthropic towards local efforts to improve the literacy rate in the county in which I reside, so from time to time I will probably bring that up.</p>

	<p><b><em>What's with the little saying?</em></b>  I'm right, aren't I?  It is pretty loud and in your face wherever one goes these days.  I'm not one of the loud ones at all.  So why not try and build a website to say what I gotta say.</p>
