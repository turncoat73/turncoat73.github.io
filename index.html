<p>Here you are, my introverted friends.  You found this page.</p>

<p>I'm betting you had to go pretty deep into search engine results to get to this page - if so, thank you.  If you went pretty deep into search engine results to get here, I've got a pretty good idea of why - all the previous results, especially on the first page, is the same old, same old you've seen before.</p>

<p>Day in, day out.  Week in, week out.</p>

<p>And, my introverted compatriot, these "same old" search results probably fall into a couple of pretty big buckets.</p>

<p>Learn to become an extrovert.  You're the one that needs to change.  You don't even need the internet to tell you that, you've probably had that rammed down your throat since before you can even remember.</p>

<p>Learn how to "turn it on" for various situations.  So basically "turn it on", and leave it on.  All the time.  See above.</p>

<p>I can't knock the site owners, contributors, bloggers, or whoever they might be for disseminating this advice.</p> 

<p>They're right.</p>

<p>Western society as we know it is a loud and in your face state of affairs, be it at work, at home, or at play.  It's tiring.  More bad news - no aspect of Western society is going to change to accommodate us anytime soon.  To get anywhere, we all have to adapt our personas at least a little bit.  I just refuse to go too far - trying to become the extrovert's extrovert to get by smacks of a lack of integrity.  So I'm not going there, ever.</p>

<p>As introverts we've got to do a whole lot more than find ways not to simply "cope", or "get through it" - life is too precious, too valuable, and WAY too short to settle for just that.  We've got to find ways to thrive.  To live.</p>

<p>So maybe you landed here after getting shut down all day at work or some other gathering, you're at the end of your rope after some "forced fun" event, or some other loud in-your-face aspect of today's society wore you down.</p>

<p>I simply can't offer anything up that will make everything better today, tomorrow, next week, next month, or next year.</p>

<p>But I'm still optimistic.</p> 

<p>I'm 40-something as I decided to undertake this, I'm still the same quiet guy I've been all my life.  But by all accounts I'm a fairly successful guy.  I'm fortunate.  I'm blessed.  But I've struggled along the way being labeled as "one of the quiet ones".</p>

<p>Whether you're 25 or 45, you've got to take the long view.  So today, tomorrow, next week, and next year, as we live in this loud world that is Western society, there are steps we can take to continue to build and broaden our skill sets, learn to invest, and learn how to build the lives we want.</p>

<p>By doing this we can quietly and peacefully set a positive example for today's in-your-face extroverted society.  Society needs us to be true to ourselves.  More than ever.</p>
