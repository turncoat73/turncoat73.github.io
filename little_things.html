<p>  My fellow introverts, you can relate to this scenario in some capacity: it's pushing 9 in the evening, and you're just getting home.</p>

<p>You're done.  Why, what went down today?</p>

<p>Maybe you had a forced fun obligation at the end of the day.</p>  

<p>Worse yet, maybe after you got talked over all day you got roped into going to a forced fun event right after that.  I've been there.</p>

<p>Your instincts tell you to run.  Get a new job, or cut out on your own.  Maybe you just want to bug out, start over somewhere.  But take a step back.</p> 

<p>Fellow introverts, this loud, loud world can be a little much, a lot of the time.  If you've resorted to the Internet for advice and you've gone through a lot of pages on your search engine to get to mine, and here I am rambling and not offering up some profound piece of advice to help deal with the loudness.  I'm not offering up a bill of goods either though.</p>

<p>It takes time and careful thought to improve your situation.  You might feel you have neither, but you've got both, more than you know.  Fellow introvert, you EXCEL at careful thought.  It is your friend.  Use it.  Now, in addition to being too busy, you're probably burnt out as well.  Bottom line, you feel that you don't have a whole lot of time, patience, or energy on a daily basis to think clearly and make life-changing decisions.</p>

<p>This all sounds pretty bleak, but know this.  There are a lot of little things you can do, day over day.  With a smart phone, it's easier and easier to take 5 minutes (or even 2 minutes) and do really little things.</p>

<p>These little things you can do can really add up.  Fast.  So, in even as little as a few months down the road, when you're putting up with the same bullshit, you can look back and see some really positive effects of the small changes you've made.</p>  

<p>You'll learn a lot in the process.</p>

<p>And, as the world screams "faster, faster, faster", you can start to feel a little smug in the knowledge that the small, thought out, and deliberate changes you're making or habits you're forming in your life are robust and more importantly they are YOURS.</p>

<p>So, to get the point, what are some of these little things?</p>  

<p>Well, I focus a lot on building a couple of small investment income streams.  I'm sure you heard this before.  Straight up - my "investment income" streams don't really amount to much more than chump change at the moment.  They currently don't amount to much because I've made the mistake in the past of trying to build these streams up too fast.</p>    

<p>What happens when you go too fast?</p>  

<p>Well, you either take big risks with cash you can't afford to lose, or you tie up cash for a few years that you may need sooner.  Not good.  I made this mistake last year.  

<p>Sure, I built a nice little chunk of change in monthly dividend income, but that was investing THOUSANDS, and the roaring stock market at the time scared the hell out of me.</p>
  
<p>This time 'round, I sleep a whole lot better knowing that I can afford to lose what I risk, and the little bits of chump change that I get every couple of weeks are satisfying.  They're mine, I building them up myself, and I'm learning from mistakes.  At present, my main focus areas for investing are reits and micro-lending.</p>
<br>
<p>I've also got this site.</p>  

<p>Looking at it the layout, or even the whole idea of building a site in general, you might be thinking "hello 1995".  Fair enough.</p>  

<p>At the time of this writing, I'm just starting out with this site.  I couldn't think of much to write about without doing years of research on a topic, so I thought I'd just share some of my life experiences, and hope they maybe help someone out there.  I swear a lot as I write - it's just a little more real that way.</p> 

<p>I recently completed a Udacity Intro to Programming course.  It cost me a bit because I took a while to complete it.  Truthfully, I was maybe procrastinating more than a little with the whole thing.</p>  

<p>The central theme of this class was all around website creation.  The last part was pretty focused on Javascript, which I found pretty difficult.</p>

<p>As I was slogging through the last part, I got pretty spun up at one point, and sent a pretty F-bomb laden email to Udacity saying "I QUIT!"  Stupid thing to do.  I was the problem here, NOT them!  I was trying to go too fast ("why won't this just WORK?!?!").  For a minute I had assumed the role of the impatient, instant gratification-seeking ones.   Gawd.</p> 

<p>When I took a step back, went REAL slow, I figured it out.  So a shout-out to the Udacity folks - the email I sent to them was not justified at all yet they were very cool about it and let me finish.  I paid good money and got pretty annoyed with Javascript - it's a use it or lose it type of skill - hence the current look and feel of site, which harkens back to the early days of grunge rock.  Maybe at some point adding a little Java will make it do cool stuff.</p>


<p>So I learned something, and I'm trying to apply it.  Who knows, maybe somebody besides me might even read it once in a while.  I keep a little cloud-based text file in my phone.  As I go through daily life, out of all the random stuff I think about comes an occasional insight or idea to write about.  I sneak off for a minute, open up this little file, and make sure I catch this insight.  So, this little project is all mine.  I'm keeping up a few skills I've learned, I'm slowly getting momentum in finding ideas to write about.  I can just get after it without having to get buy-in from a dozen different people with a dozen differing opinions.</p>
